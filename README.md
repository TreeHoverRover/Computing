# Background
A rover based on a version of the Sawppy project, Curio. Plan is to experiment with robotic movement, sensing, data collection and analysis in under-the-canopy surveys for optimised woodland mensuration initially. The build process requires hardware and software setup which is the topic of the following guidelines. Information on how to setup the Raspberry Pi and the ROS was mostly taken from [here](https://www.intorobotics.com/how-to-install-ros-melodic-rosserial-and-more-on-raspberry-pi-4-raspbian-buster/).

# Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB is the computer of choice to *manage hardware components and run algorithms to control the robot*. At the time of writing, this version is capable of running ROS, algorithms to detect objects, and deep learning algorithms. 

## List of components
* Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8GB of RAM
* Power Supply 5V 3A USB-C adapter (used the one from my smartphone)
* An unofficial 1TB MicroSD card (PNY)
* Full-size USB adapter for the microSD card
* A keyboard and a mouse
* A screen with HDMI input

## How to install Raspberry Pi OS on Raspberry Pi 4
In this part of the tutorial, we explain how to install Raspberry Pi OS on the Raspberry Pi 4. We choose to install this for two reasons:
1. It is the official operating system of the Raspberry Pi computers;
2. It is compatible with ROS Melodic. Melodic is a Long Term Support release which ends in 2023;

Raspberry Pi OS is a computer operating system officially provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation as the primary operating system for the family of Raspberry Pi. The operating system includes a set of basic programs and utilities that helps you to develop and execute programs. It performs as a bridge between you and the hardware of Pi and manages the CPU, memory, memory disk, GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins, and more.

Installing the Raspberry Pi  operating system has become much easier by using the Raspberry Pi Imager software. The program includes the option to erase and to write the microSD memory card used for Pi.

1. [Download](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) and install Raspberry Pi Imager to a computer with an SD card reader. Put the SD card you'll use with your Raspberry Pi into the reader and run Raspberry Pi Imager. We used the Windows version in this case.
**Note:** *If the memory card used is new, you don’t need to erase and format the card. Otherwise, you have to use the Raspberry Pi Imager to erase and format the card.*
2. Select the Raspberry Pi OS (32bit) as the Operating System, your SD card and click *write.

After the process of writing the image of the operating system on the memory card is finished, insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi’s slot and power up the board.


## How to communicate with Raspberry Pi

#### Enable SSH for remote access
Secure Shell (SSH) is a network protocol that allows us to operate the Pi board securely over an unsecured network like the internet. We can achieve this by logging into our Raspberry Pi via SSH using the user and the IP address from our laptop. We can also use SSH to connect to Pi in our LAN. 

Using this service, we can run commands on Pi without needing to plug in a display, a keyboard, a mouse or moving ourselves to the location of the Raspberry Pi each time. This service is indispensible in the situation where the Pi board is running on a mobile robot like the one we are building.

SSH (and [Virtual Network Computing](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/vnc-raspberry-pi)) involve opening a port on Raspberry Pi (5900+N for VNC and 22 for SSH). This potentially exposes your Raspberry Pi and is generally considered as a security vulnerability that should ideally be avoided. Hackers actively look for Raspberry Pi devices with these open ports and default passwords. 

To remain on the safe side, we decided to use a third-party service to form a secure remote connection to our Raspberry Pi. Let's take a look at remote.it to understand how to access our Raspberry Pi remotely without port forwarding. We will use remote.it's client to form a peer-to-peer network. Remote.it claims this is a safer way to set up a gateway than traditional VPN.

![remote.it](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54486032/104328091-61cbfd00-54e3-11eb-955e-1f77c1d161fb.png)

First, activate SSH on Raspberry Pi. Boot with the GUI , click on the main menu and choose *Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration*, choose the *Interfaces* tab and set *SSH Enabled*. The same process can be followed if booting on the command line and typing *raspi-config* to follow the same options.

Then,  make sure your Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet (ethernet or wireless LAN). Open the Terminal window and enter the following commands: 
'''sudo apt update
sudo apt install remoteit
'''

When the packages are installed, the Terminal outputs the configuration information to continue your device configuration.

![config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54486032/104459563-cdc26a00-55a4-11eb-9888-bf5b50d98538.png)

 Finish the setup by adding your Pi device to remote.it. Make sure your local PC is connected to the same wifi (LAN) as the Pi. Then visit http://find.remote.it and you should see there is one device discovered. You now need to create a new account on remote.it. 
 
 To access your Pi from anywhere, download and install the [remote.it client](https://remote.it/downloads/#pi) for your OS. Run the client and you will then be directed to register a new device. In the device registration page, you will be ask to provided a name for the device. After filling in the device name, please make sure that “ssh” service is selected as we wish to ssh into the Pi remotely. Click *Connect* and then select *ssh* to view the relevant settings.

The way we connected to our Raspberry Pi was via Powershell from Windows. You can also use a terminal in Unix/Mac or another SSH client like Putty.Remote.it configuration panel as shown on the last image above provides the relevant SSH command to copy-paste directly to your Powershell or terminal along with the individual URL and port number if using Putty for example. 

Now that you are connected to your Pi let's move on to install ROS. 

#### Some notes on additional security
The default *pi* user with its' *raspberry* password is prone to attacks therefore we deleted this user from our Raspberry Pi and created our new user with superuser permissions. Since we aim to run commands via SSH right after the Pi is powered up and connected to the internet, the solution is to permit root login. Open the Terminal and run the command:
'''linux
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
'''
Scroll down to *Authentication* and uncomment the line *#PermitRootLogin* by deleting the # and then write *yes*. Save the file with *Ctrl + o* and exit with *Ctrl + x*.
