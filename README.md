# Background
A rover based on a version of the Sawppy project, Curio. Plan is to experiment with robotic movement, sensing, data collection and analysis in under-the-canopy surveys for optimised woodland mensuration initially. The build process requires hardware and software setup which is the topic of the following project.

# Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB is the computer of choice to *manage hardware components and run algorithms to control the robot*. At the time of writing, this version is capable of running ROS, algorithms to detect objects, and deep learning algorithms.

### List of components:
* Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 8GB of RAM
* Power Supply 5V 3A USB-C adapter (used the one from my smartphone)
* An unofficial 1TB MicroSD card (PNY)
* Full-size USB adapter for the microSD card
* A keyboard and a mouse
* A screen with HDMI input
